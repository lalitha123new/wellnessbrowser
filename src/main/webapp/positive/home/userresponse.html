					(Hedonic)</h3>
				<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;" ng-show="hhigh">
					Your scores suggest that in the last one month, you seem to be
					engaging in pleasure -oriented activities at a higher frequency
					than most other people. Such activities can give a temporary boost
					to your well-being, but often this boost is short lasting. This
					means that one is required to engage in such activities again and
					again in order to feel good.<br>Although there is nothing
					abnormal in itself about this, it could be problematic in a few
					situations:<br> a) When these are often carried out at the
					cost of/in ways that interfere with your doing other activities
					that do not give you immediate pleasure but are useful for you in
					the longer run,<br> b) When these pleasure-oriented activities
					are harmful for your health <br> c) Sometimes, frequently
					engaging in such activities can actually be a marker of feeling
					distressed. There are times when we try to cope with our negative
					feelings (e.g. sadness, hurt, anxiety or boredom) by seeking out
					pleasure –oriented activities to get a quick relief/to feel better.
					This can lift our mood help us to an extent, but we need to
					simultaneously figure out how to deal with the underlying distress
					and think of other methods of coping too which have longer term
					benefits.<br> Therefore we need to balance these with
					meaning-oriented activities that can enhance our overall
					well-being.
				</p>
				<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;" ng-show="haverage">Your scores
					falls on the average side, which means that in the last one month,
					you seem to be engaging in pleasure-oriented activities as often as
					most other people. These can give a temporary boost to your
					well-being. However, too frequent engagement i such activities can
					interfere with other kinds of activities that are useful and
					healthier in the longer run. Therefore it would be good to balance
					these with investing time in meaning-oriented activities that can
					enhance our overall well-being.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;" ng-show="hlow">
					Your scores fall on the lower side, which means that in the last
					one month, you seem to be engaging in passive pleasure-oriented
					activities less often than most other people. This may reflect a
					focus on longer term goals rather than immediate pleasures.<br>Cautionary
					note: However, we hope that you are carrying out other kinds of
					active, constructive and personally meaningful activities that can
					provide the longer lasting fuel to maintain /enhance your
					wellbeing. In case, your overall level of engagement in any kind of
					activities has come down recently, it could point to the
					possibility of depression. Look up the resource- section for
					checking if you may be depressed.
